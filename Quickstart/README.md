# Spring Quickstart Guide

### What you'll build

You will build a classic “Hello World!” endpoint which any browser can connect to. You can even tell it your name, and it will respond in a more friendly way.

### What you’ll need

##### An Integrated Developer Environment (IDE)

Popular choices include IntelliJ IDEA, Spring Tools, Visual Studio Code, or Eclipse, and many more.

##### A Java™ Development Kit (JDK)

We recommend AdoptOpenJDK version 8 or version 11.
